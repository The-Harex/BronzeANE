    "description": "The **Enuma Elish** is the Babylonian creation epic that recounts how the cosmos was formed through divine conflict, culminating in the rise of the god Marduk as supreme ruler. Beginning with the primordial waters Apsu and Tiamat, the myth describes a generational struggle among the gods that leads to chaos and war after Tiamat seeks revenge for the disruption of the old order. Marduk defeats Tiamat in a climactic battle, splits her body to create the heavens and the earth, and establishes cosmic order. Humanity is then fashioned from the blood of a rebel god to serve the gods, reflecting a worldview in which divine hierarchy, kingship, and order are central. The epic also functions politically and religiously, legitimizing Babylon’s dominance and Marduk’s supremacy within the Mesopotamian pantheon.\r\n",
